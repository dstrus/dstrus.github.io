        <h4><a href="http://www.indyrb.org/posts/2019/04/10/meetup-apr10/" target="_blank">Remote Pairing: Tools &amp; Practices</h4></a></h4>
        <p>with Dana Palazzo</p>
        <p>
            The benefits of pair programming are well-documented—and accessible to even remote workers. In our workshop, we discuss tips, best practices, and tools we’ve used to pair efficiently, constructively, and enjoyably when working from different cities.

        <h4><a href="http://www.indyrb.org/posts/2017/10/11/meetup-october11/" target="_blank">The Path to Senior</a></h4>
        <p>I attempt to define "senior developer" and provide actionable steps for growth for those who are not quite there yet, and for seniors who still want to keep learning (which ought to be all of them!). (Note: I've given this talk several more times, and it has been refined a great deal since the instance recorded here.)</p>
